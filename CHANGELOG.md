- Enhance AST with detailed span tracking, introduce 'number' type alias, improve stdlib path resolution, and add VSCode extension icons.
- Implement module import/export resolution in semantic analysis and ARM64 code generation.
- Refactor standard library loading to use `core.aura` from a specified path instead of hardcoded class definitions.
- Add `UndefinedFunction` semantic error detection and a corresponding test case.
- And VSCode extension configuration updates (Restart Server).
- Implement multi-file compilation with per-file type tracking and core module integration, and add ARM64 stack helpers.
- Overhaul CLI argument parsing to support explicit commands, options, and a detailed help message, controlling build and run behavior.
- Implement cross-file "go to definition" functionality by adding file path information to symbol definitions and updating import statement parsing.
- Add built-in constants, pre-declare variables during semantic analysis, and normalize import paths to always include the `.aura` extension.
- Enhance semantic analysis with duplicate declaration checks and introduce ARM64 register definitions for code generation.
- Add semantic checks for duplicate field and method declarations, including name conflicts.
- Add keyword and built-in function completion items to the LSP server.
- Add `const` keyword support and enforce immutability for constant declarations in the semantic checker.
